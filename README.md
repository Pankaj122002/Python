# These projects involve using machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions or forecasts. These projects typically involve training a model on historical data and then using that model to predict future outcomes or trends.The process usually involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection or engineering, model training, and evaluation. The choice of the machine learning algorithm depends on the nature of the prediction task, such as regression for numerical predictions or classification for categorical predictions.
